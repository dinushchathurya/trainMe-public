      "[\"Hello, good morning. My name is Nisala Chintan Perera and my matrilation number is 92124836. Passport. It's here. Right, so let's start. Okay, good morning everyone. And first of all, I want to thank you all for giving me this time. I know you are busy person but thank you for giving me this time. I am Nisal Perra as you know. I am the co-founder and CTO of the company, Jalat Marketplace. So we are actually here to discuss about the transition from our current system to a digitalized system.\", 'Okay so current situation so Jalat marketplace is one of the largest market chains in Sri Lanka so we provide services almost half of the population in Sri Lanka.', \"So we have a traditional on-premise shopping where you go to the supermarket and you buy your stuff and we have online shopping where we have an online portal and you can order them and we deliver them to your doorstep and take away shopping. That's actually a unique method of our own. So what we do, we analyze past customers, royalty customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers. So what we do, we analyze past customers.\", \"So they don't have to come to the supermarket or anything. If they want, they can edit or they can add more or remove items from the list. So we send a verification notification, notification to verify the list we are going to send them to. And they can verify it and then we deliver them. So no need to come to the supermarket at all. So currently all these processes are actually manual processes. We don't have any automated systems.\", 'So there are set of employees in each branch that are dedicated to the tasks. So online on-premise shopping actually includes many manual processes like stocking the products and looking out for like out of shelves and payments, ordering, lost of management, those things. And then we have online shopping, online shopping also we have manual processes. So other than manual processes from on-premise shopping, we have to prepare the order, and we have to send off the delivery. So those are manually done.', 'So other than manual processes from on-premise and online shopping, we have to analyze the POS database to provide the customers and we have to prepare the order. So those things are actually done manually. Right, so a little bit of statistics here. So this is the wastage. wastage means perishable foods. So you can see this is actually average to the month for four years right now. So August means that from 2019 to this year average August wastage and September, October, and November. So that is the average August wastage.', 'So yes, because of those festivals seasons in Sri Lanka, the wastage becomes more and more high. And then these other statistics of the supermarket employees spending time on their tasks. So as you can see here also towards the season, December, this also applied for a precision also towards the season, this time consumption goes up.', \"So first features, first feature is a shelf compliance system that is actually what we currently do is we create a planogram that's the blueprint of the shelf and we do the compliance manually. We go to the shelf and do the compliance manually by our employees. But in this system, we are going to give a mobile app to the employees. So they just have to take a picture of the shelf after they created the planogram on the shelf.\", 'And this, if there is a non-compliance aspect of the shelf, then there will be a notification coming through the mobile phone application. So there will be a special resource management system that assigns an employee to a task, to an uncomplaint task. So that will be done separately. And then after that we have an AI based out of stock alarm system for shelves. So this is actually where the products on the shelf are going out. So currently our plan is to put 20% as threshold and when the products, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the product, the', 'And then we have an event prediction system. So we can predict how much of each product will sell off next day, week or month so we can order what we need automatically and then we have the product selection system that is for loyalty customers. So this system is for loyalty customers. And then we have AI based queue management system counters.', 'So we will discuss that in future slides. Yeah, so current job roles in our branches. So each branch has these job roles and these number of persons per branch. So first one is sorters. Sorters are like people who look after the products like when they are going out of shelves, they restock them. And when a notification comes like when the new line ofgram comes they arrange the shelves according to that so that type of product is going out of shelves. So we will discuss that in future slides. Yeah, so so current job roles in our branches. So each branch has these job roles and these number of persons per branch. So first one is sorters. Sorters are like people who look after the products like when they are going out of shelves, they restock them. And when a notification comes, they restock them. And when a notification comes, they arrange the shelves according to that type of product is going out of stock.', \"So the number of sources per branch right now and the number is changing after the digitalization, we will discuss that in the next few slides. The next job role is Analyst. So basically what they do is they just analyze the POS and prepare the list of products for lower-end customers. So that's actually pretty hard job analyzing hundreds of transactions and bills. So we have three people per branch and then we have a planner.\", \"So he or she, this person will create the shelves that maximizes the sales. so he or she, this person will create the shelves that maximizes the sales. so we only have one branch then we have three cashiers to check out items and yes so now let's see how these job roles will be changing in future with this digitalization. So for SOTUS, their job role will be reduced, responsibilities will be reduced. So after the digitalization, the job roles will be reduced.\", \"So what they have to do is actually take a picture of the shelf. That's all from the mobile application that's all it will be done automatically and if there is an issue so what will be assigned automatically so no voice and also so that does not have to look out for out of shelves anymore so the system will automatically detect if the product is going out of shelves. So and a notification will be sent to the mobile application that's all it will be done automatically. So what they have to do is actually take a picture of the shelf. That's all from the mobile application that's all it will be done automatically and if there is an issue so what will be assigned automatically so no voice and also so that does not have to look out for out of shelves anymore so the system will automatically detect if the product is going out of shelves. So and a notification will be sent to the mobile application.\", 'So in the previous slide I told you that we are going to expand the cashiers depending on the Q size. For the cashiers we are going to reserve three sorters as cashiers so when the system detects that the waiting time is longer then the cashier will automatically assign and then all the notifications will be delivered using the Q. So in the previous slide I told you that we are going to expand the cashiers depending on the Q size. And also there will be three sorters reserved as additional cashiers. So in the previous slide I told you that we are going to expand the cashiers depending on the Q size. For the cashiers we are going to reserve three sorters as cashiers so when the system detects that the waiting time is longer then the cashier will automatically assign and then all the notifications will be delivered using the Q.', '10. The analysis so in analysis the brawls so there will be a change and they do not have to worry about the analysis of the customer buying patterns. So the system will be done, the system will be calculated automatically and only what actually they have to do is finalize the order and they have to verify depending on the figures we get from the system and the list. So they have to verify with the customer that this is what they need.', 'So for the planner also there will be a reduction of responsibilities. So the planner does not have to do the sales analysis manually so it will be done automatically and also the planogram will also be done automatically so he the planner does not have to worry about that although the if planner needs they can do the analysis they can change the analysis if needed and planner should actually verify the planogram before rolling the planogram out to the shortest. Yes.', 'The cache is the responsibilities will not be changing but the shifts will be shorter and they will have much more free time now to refresh themselves and Since there is a queue management system there will be more cashier adding in but Decreasing the number of cashier so the cashiers will not be changed much. Right so as we know the young people, young people are more like, they are more like. Right so as we know the young people, they are more like. Right so as we know the young people, they are more like.', 'But all the people like us, they are a bit resistant to the changes. So there will be some people that will hesitate to adapt to the new systems. So what we are suggesting is that any employee who is hesitant to adapt to the new system, they can talk to their managers or team leaders, no problem. And the company will provide any additional support they need. Maybe it will be in terms of training or in terms of different responsibilities.', \"So, yeah, for the resistance, those people can actually discuss with the management. We are pretty flexible on that aspect. So let's talk about the transition strategy, like how we are going to transit from the digital system to a... sorry, manual system to sorry manual system digital. Right. So the rollout date hasn't been decided yet. So it has to be decided. And when the rollout has done, actually before the rollout, we are going to provide full training. So, yeah, for the resistance, those people can actually discuss with the management. We are pretty flexible on that aspect. So let's talk about the transition strategy, like how we are going to transit from the digital system to a... sorry, manual system to sorry manual system digital. Right. So the rollout has to be decided. And when the rollout has done, actually before the rollout, we are going to provide full training.\", 'We are going to take a month to train everyone and this training sessions will include workshops, classes, training sessions etc. so everything like understanding how digital system works, how AI works, what are the problems with AI, and what are the drawbacks and how we can interact with it and how to mitigate those drawbacks. So everything will be included in those training sessions and this training actually the frequency of these trainings will be reduced up to bi-monthly.', \"So this actually the time span depends on the evaluation we are going to do on training sessions and we will decide the high management will decide when to stop the training. And also the important thing is the people, the employees can actually request additional training sessions if they need. It may be for a team, it may be for the whole branch, it may be for the individual people, it doesn't matter. If the employee is requested, it will be for the entire team, it may be for the whole branch, it may be for the individual people, it doesn't matter.\", 'So, you know, some of the very bright ideas came from non-tech people. So, we are open to suggestions. If they have any suggestions, they can just talk We will consider those suggestions in the future. Yeah, so the evaluation will be done like a small test after each training. So this is not an evaluation on how the training is going to be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done. So, this is not an evaluation on how the training will be done.', \"So this is the training. So this is what, so how much training we need to schedule in future. So that's the main reason we are doing this evaluation after trainings. So this is the end of the session. So if I conclude my presentation, so we are going to digitalize our market system. So main reason is to reduce time and product waste and we are also focusing on providing better services for the customers and we are more focused on relaxed and very free workspace for the customers.\"]\n"
